                        Our News Verification project was developed by a team of
                        four students—Srihari, Nakshatra, Hima, and Aryan—who
                        came together to tackle the challenge of misinformation.
                        <br />
                        Srihari built an ML model to extract key facts from
                        user-submitted article URLs and integrated the entire
                        backend system. <br />
                        Aryan's model analyzes these facts by searching relevant
                        articles to verify if the information is supported,
                        contradicted, or inconclusive. <br />
                        Nakshatra focused on core frontend development and
                        integration with the ML models. <br />
                        Hima crafted the website’s styling, ensuring a
                        user-friendly experience. Together, we deliver a
                        seamless fact-checking tool.

                        In our News Verification project, there are two Large
                        Language models used to effectively produce the desired
                        output of facts and reasonable validation. <br />
                        1. User begins by entering the URL of an article they
                        want to verify. <br />
                        2. The first model, a PEGASUS model finetuned using Low
                        Rank Adaptation (LoRA), generates facts from the
                        article, identifying key claims made.
                        <br />
                        3. After postprocessing, these facts are sent to the
                        second stage. For each fact, upto 5 relevant searches
                        are found.<br />
                        Each fact is tested against the contents of each similar
                        article through an uncased DistilBERT model finetuned on
                        Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI), which
                        analyzes the content of these articles and checks
                        whether the extracted facts are supported, contradicted,
                        or inconclusive. <br />
                        4. The results are then presented to the user, providing
                        a clear indication of the factual accuracy of the
                        original article.
