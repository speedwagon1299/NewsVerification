1. Disable right side scroll bar so that we can't scroll back to the landing page after reaching the second page.

2. Make the words appear the way they do in Chatgpt (looking like they are being typed in real time)

3. Progress Bar/ Scrolling icon

4. Alignment of icon and heading (go to paint, make an image such that it is properly aligned and of the right size and then insert the image. Haven't yet figured out a better way to properly align it)

5. The use of the search bar in the second page is not obvious, it needs to somehow be made more intuitive (the purpose is to ensure that if a person wants to search another article they are able to directly on the second page as they can no longer scroll up to the landing page)

6. Make the motion of search bar while scrolling look more dynamic and clear.

7. Design, fonts etc

8. Need to buy roughly 45 seconds from the time the term in search bar is entered till the final result is displayed (progress bar? Loading icon? Typing out the article? Captcha?)
